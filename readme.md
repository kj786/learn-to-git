# Learn to Git. 

Learn the basics of Git and Github. Have fun. All exercises are meant to be completed with a partner, because everything is more fun in pairs.

## Basic Workflow

> Only one person (user a) needs to do this part.

1. Finish the exercises in the basic-workflow.js file. 
2. Create a new repo
3. Add the file
4. Commit
5. Push

Congrats you just passed the basics! Add user b to the repo.

## Merge Conflicts

1. User b should Clone the repo.
2. Then s/he should add a new subtraction exercise and change the wording on the multiplication exercise instructions.
4. Meanwhile, the user a should add a new addition exercise and also change the wording of the multiplication instructions. Keep it simple.
5. Add, commit, push, the code. (Both users)
7. Work through the conflicts together.

## Branching

1. After the conflicts are dealt with, create two separate branches called "multiplication" and "division", respectively.
2. Learn how to checkout a new branch.
2. User a should add two new multiplication exercises.
3. User b should add two new division exercises. 
4. How do you merge the branches with the master branch? Who should push/merge first? Does it matter?

## Pull Requests

1. User b should fork the repo
2. Then Create a new branch
3. Then refactor code
4. Add, commit, push, create a pull request
5. User a should review the changes
6. Then decide whether to commit

#### All done. Switch rolls. Do it again. Create harder exercise problems for practice.
